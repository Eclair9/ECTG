            <h2>Grinding for Silver Coins and Ring Fragments</h2>
            <p>
                Kill some Cobras or Fluffies in the Slayer Dungeon while mining iron ore. Use the iron ore to craft a large amount of steel bars, then use the steel bars to craft several Spiked Shields. Finally, sell the Spiked Shields for silver coins.
            </p><br><br>
            <h2>Grinding for Gold Coins</h2>
            <p>
                This is more of an end-game or late-game build. Relying only on Gold Touch Potions offers a limited chance to earn gold. Most players nowadays use the Opulina Set with all Wishing Wells maxed out. For now, try finding rare items from caskets to sell, or consider working for someone in tasks like farming and exploration. You can also join the CherryTree Discord channel to find potential employers.
